                <h2>OS_P</h2>
                <p>OS_P is an operating system project I am currently working on. It is my most ambitious project and one of the projects I have learned the most from.</p>
                <p>The final aim of this operating system is to have a full text based operating system by making everything from scratch, this includes the Bootloader and Kernel.</p>
