                <h2>JJournal</h2>
                <p>JJournal was my Dissertation project at university, it shows a basic proof of concept mobile application with the purpose of being a mood journal that uses a persons app usage data to potentially draw a correlation between that person's mood and what applications they tend to use.</p>
                <p>The drawings from the project ended up showing that, while there is evidence to suggest that using some applications while in certain moods was common, there was a struggle to find any evidence to suggest the balance between the applications being used due to a person's mood, and the use of the applications causing a different mood.</p>
                <p><strong>Developed Using: </strong>Java, Android Studio</p>

                <h2>File Storage</h2>
                <p>This was a group project created during my second year of university. Me and one other student were tasked with creating an application that could save files securely over the cloud. With a Docker container acting as the main cloud server, and the file being encrypted and saved in multiple chunks for safer storage.</p>
                <p><strong>Developed Using: </strong>Java, Docker, SQLite, JavaFX</p>

                <h2>Fishermun</h2>
                <p>This project was created as a part of Hacknotts 2021, during my first year of university. It is a simple game about catching different fish.</p>
                <p>This project was created in 24 hours from a team of 4, and won 2nd place in the event that year.</p>
                <p><strong>Developed Using: </strong>Python, Pygame</p>

                <h2>Rubik's GL</h2>
                <p>This was one of the final submission during my first year of university, we were only tasked with making a simple C++ program, however I decided to push myself and made a much more complex program.</p>
                <p>Rubik's GL was made from my love of solving the rubik's cube, I didn't have the knowledge at the time to get it exactly how I wanted it, but I am still happy with what I did.</p>
                <p><strong>Developed Using: </strong>C++, OpenGL</p>
